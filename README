CHI

CHI provides a unified caching API, designed to assist a developer in persisting data for
a specified period of time.

The CHI interface is implemented by driver classes that support fetching, storing and
clearing of data. Driver classes exist or will exist for the gamut of storage backends
available to Perl, such as memory, plain files, memory mapped files, memcached, and DBI.

CHI is intended as an evolution of DeWitt Clinton's Cache::Cache package, adhering to the
basic Cache API but adding new features and addressing limitations in the Cache::Cache
implementation.
